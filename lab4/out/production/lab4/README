Lab 4

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.

EX1
Q1.1
This is a idea of incremental development, it saves time in long run because you can guarantee the basic implementation is correct by having some tests and modifications. When encountering bugs afterwards, debugging will be easier because there's no need to worry about the basic implementation

EX2
Q2.1
nums.in: -17
test1.in: -2147483648
test2.in: 0

Q2.2
[1, 2, 2147483647]
[45, -76, 0, 2147483647, 7, 1234]

EX3
Q3.1
for nums.in
(17 17 21 18)
(3 -7 10 17 9 -17 17 21 18 7)
(3 -7 10 17 9 17 21 18 7)
()

Q3.2
for test3.in
(21 2147483647)
(-17 21 10 2147483647 0)
(21 10 2147483647 0)
(2147483647)

EX4
Q4.1
example1: 2.33
example2: string

Q4.2
 (nums.valuesGT(threshold)).printVals();

Q4.3
Nums

Q4.4
Nums gtNums = nums.valuesGT(threshold);
gtNums.printVals();

Q4.5
ArrayList has lower efficiency than Array. Also, the initialization and element access can be more complex

Q4.6
ArrayList can grow and shrink.

Q4.7
1. No. we can read in while printing out.
2. No. We only need to store one minimum value while reading in the numbers.
3. No. Task 1 and task 2 can be done at the same time.
4. No. We can compare every input number with the threshold value while reading in a sequence of numbers
5. Yes. Since we cannot compare each number with the threshold value before we get it, we need to save all the numbers and decide which ones to print out afterwards.
6. Yes. The sequence of numbers is needed more than once (to do different computations and print out)
